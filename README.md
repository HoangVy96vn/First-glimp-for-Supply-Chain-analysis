Case study: have first understanding of sale and success order rate from a supplier for candy

Raw data in 2 files: shipped_order.csv and canceled_order.csv

Context: we're new to position Data analyst for a company producing candy and shipped to retailers. We have files of successful shipped orders and cancelled order of January and February with information of Item Code, Line, Shipping Address (prepent for retailers), Quantity Ordered and Quantity Cancelled.
Let's analyze 2 initial file to understand about our retailers, success shipp-out rate, etc.

With nalyzing phases: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act
I proceed some phases with:
1. Ask: Our purpose is to have initial understanding. So let's list down somethings:
      a/ Daily or period demand
      b/ Percentage delivered order versus Total Order, by day, by item, by retailers,...
      Also, for each case, what is the max, min, average
      c/ Classify into categories of SKU criteria: %delivered/order and find which way to classify
2. Prepare - skip this step as data was ready
3. Process - file: Check data cleaning and basic information.ipynb
      This phase, we'll check how many data we have, any NaN, any error, duplicate,... check data types, data sets

4. Analyze: file: you can reach out 2 files
      a) Report supply test.ipynb: I code everything on this file to test my hypothesis and find insights. This file is not suitable for presenting because it contents too much information and might cause misleading for reader
      b) Report  by Python.ipynb: In this file, I just make it easier to read and presenting
In overall, we answer some questions we make from Ask phase, also clarify information by look deeper to data, and also make questions for further investigation which means deeper analyzing by other data groups.
By the way, we can use Power BI or Tableau for quicker visualization. I wanted to write down codes so that I can get feedback from our community and also train my skills in Python
